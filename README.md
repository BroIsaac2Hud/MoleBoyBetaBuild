# MoleBoyBetaBuild

Title: Mole Boy

Creator: Isaac

Code: Uses GameMaker Studio 2's GML (GameMaker Language).

Description: Mole Boy; This is a high-score based game where you play as a mole that's trying to obtain treasure by tunneling as deep underground as possible, finding gold and eating worms in the process. It is currently at Milestone 2 of 10 in development.

Instructions: Use the left and right arrows to move horizontally, and use the space bar to perform a fast drill attack. The game can be sped up using the "G" key, and Mole Boy's horizontal and attack speed can be increased with the "M" key. The game can also be paused with the "P" key, and the score/stage can be reset with the "R" key. Avoid saws, eat worms, and drill attack through rocks for a high score (in both cash and depth distance).

Goal of the project: Be a fun arcade-style game.

How to access: Download the zip file of the project, unzip it, and open the Gamemaker Project file titled "Mole Boy Beta 1.0.0" with GameMaker Studio 2 already installed.
